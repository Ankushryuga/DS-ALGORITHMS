GREEDY ALGORITHM: SOLVING A PROBLEM BY SELECTING THE BEST OPTION AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT, IT DOESN'T WORRY WHETHER THE CURRENT BEST RESULT WILL BRING THE OVERALL
OPTIMAL SOLUTION.

GREEDY ALGORITHM, IT NEVER REVERSES ITS EARLIER DECISION EVEN IF IT WAS WRONG. GREEDY ALGORITHM WORK ON TOP-DOWN APPROACH.
GREEDY ALGORITHM, MAY NOT PRODUCE BEST RESULT ALL THE TIME, BECAUSE IT GOES FOR LOCAL BEST SOLUTION TO PRODUCE GLOBAL OPTIMAL SOLUTION.

1. GREEDY CHOICE PROPERTY: IF AN OPTIMAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM CAN BE FOUND BY CHOOSING THE BEST CHOICE AT EACH STEP WITHOUT RECONSIDRING THE PREVIOUS STEPS ONCE CHOSEN, 
THE PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED USING A GREEDY APPROACH. THIS PROPERTY IS CALLED GREEDY CHOICE PROPERTY.

2. OPTIMAL STRUCTURE: IF THE OPTIMAL OVERALL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM CORRESPONDS TO THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION TO ITS SUBPROBLEMS, THEN THE PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED USING A GREEDY
APPROACH. THIS PROPERTY IS CALLED OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE. 

##### ADVANTAGES OF GREEDY APPROACH: #####
1. THE ALGORITHM IS EASIER TO DESCRIBE.
2. THIS ALGORITHM CAN PERFORM BETTER THAN OTHER ALGORITHMS (BUT, NOT IN ALL CASES).
